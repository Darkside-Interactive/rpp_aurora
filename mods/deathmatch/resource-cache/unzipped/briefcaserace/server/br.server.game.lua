--TO DO
-- in server.spawn, track timers that spawn players and timers that show gui, so they can be destroyed if the map ends, etc. (done, need testing)
-- make team menu gui support higher number of teams (screen only shows up to 17 teams right now)
-- make variable teams option.. teams are auto-generated as player count increases. 6 players per team? what skins do they use? (done, needs testing)
-- maybe carrier vehicle 'gravity' is too low, needs testing (needs testing)
-- maybe when briefcase is stuck in air, make it slowly lower to the ground
-- make cars only drop from collision damage, not from weapon damage (done, REALLY needs testing)
-- do player blips work? make them color-coded to team? (done, need testing) (sometimes blips get left behind?)
-- some garage cols are bad, gonna need to get the sizes of those myself (done, at least for san fierro)
-- dead guys sometimes get briefcase? (maybe when they spawn they hit it if it was at theit death location).. REALLY needs testing --> one solution, make it not hittable for a few secs after spawn
-- on finish, victory message isn't displayed (in team mode): for enemy, works on delivery? (fixed?)
-- make teams more easily identifiable.. nametag colors etc.. team skins option? (done, but more could be done)
-- think of better ways to have cars drop briefcases (maybe they drop too easily when damaged, use x^2?) (irrelevant now)
-- have passenger-only drivebys (done)
-- find a better briefcase icon
-- add FF option in settings (done)
-- add briefcases to places inaccessible by cars.. rooftops, interiors.. so people get out of their cars sometimes. maybe create a different map for that? (done)
-- make waiting screens pretty, so players see it whenever they are not ready (kind of done, but doesn't always work)
-- add spectator mode? add click to spawn?? (no, forget it... well maybe as a seperate option selectable frmo the team menu)
-- add time-limit? as it approaches, increase game speed? play sound from gta3?
-- play objective complete sound on delivery
-- IN TEAM MODE, CAN'T SEE OBJECTIVE MARKER AFTER FIRST DELIVERY (fixed)
-- prevent teams for cheating to get points: (done)
--  don't give them points from jacking the orb from eachother's cars
--  limit points after drop.. e.g. they only get the 20 the first couple of times they pick up a particular briefcase (make this for non-teams as well?)
-- make bike fall-off make you drop briefcase!! (or whenever startExit doesn't trigger and only exit triggers? so for all involuntary exits...) (done)
-- make it so... the faster the vehicle, the easier it drops (or classify into: coupes, sedans, old cars, trucks, big trucks, etc) (done)
-- add spray shops for vehicle repairs, or repair pickups? (done)
-- add weapon pickups (randomly placed?)
-- add a volatility meter client-side so people see how easily they can drop the orb (done) (removed, irrelevant now)
-- put stuff into settings and make some of it adjustable in the middle of the game (hiding/showing destiantion to players, etc.) (done)
-- finish implementing team support (done)
--  make each team have a different objective
--  make negative annoucements red for teams, positive blue (done?)
-- display who carrier is (done, press tab)
-- objective not accurate at high speeds (or is it?) (it is)
-- reset flag after idle time (done?)
-- make enter/exit vehicle events be triggered from client script (why?)
-- too many add event handlers? (huh?)
-- make vehicle hit detection client-side for the player hitting the orb carrier? (why?) (maybe to distinguish between car hits and gun hits.. car hits should drop more easily than gun hits)
--SUGGESTIONS
-- don't show objective until orb is picked up (done)
-- don't show objective to other players while someone has orb (done)
--BUG
-- onCarrierEnterVehicle is not always triggered for some unknown reason (should be fixed, updated event name...)
-- onVehicleStartExit_brgame not called when falling from bike (fixed?)
-- MTA BUGS:
--  vehicles take damage when being jacked from another player, possible reason:
--    [14:53] <erorr404> my theory is that when you call fixVehicle() server-side, the server sets the vehicle's health variable to 1000, but the synching client (who does not know the new health yet) sends a packet with the old vehicle health, which is lower than 1000
--    [14:53] <erorr404> then it compares the new health (sent by client) and the old health and sees that it has dropped
--    [14:53] <erorr404> and calls onVehicleDamage
--   one solution: after calling repair vehicle (from spray shops), have it ignore damage done for the next second or so (done)
--  colshape hit events sometimes seem to get triggered for no reason? (could be my fault)
--  setGarageOpen() only takes effect after reconnect, not when the resource starts [server] (works when first starting, when connecting, but not after restarting resource)
--  getGarageSize() returns shitty values (mostly for the X, sometimes for Y) [client]

-- client events:
--  clientGiveBriefcaseToPlayer			r, g, b
--  clientTakeBriefcaseFromPlayer
--  clientCreateIdleBriefcase 			x, y, z
--  clientDestroyIdleBriefcase

--  clientCreateObjective				x, y, z, showBlip
--  clientSetObjectiveHittable			hittable, showBlip
--  clientDestroyObjective
--  clientCreateTeamObjective			team, friendly, x, y, z -- friendly determines what the blip looks like: true - large flag icon, large blip
--  clientSetTeamObjectiveHittable		team, hittable
--  clientDestroyTeamObjective			team
