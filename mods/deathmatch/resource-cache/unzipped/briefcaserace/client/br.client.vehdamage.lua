-- This script calls the sever whenever the checkElement is shot at. It can also package multiple shots and send them as one event to save bandwidth.
-- This event should be added for one client only, or the server will recieve the same damage event from multiple clients.
-- How event packaging works: On event, wait MAX_WAIT_TIME. If nothing happens in that time, send. On next event, 1) cancel old wait time if exists, 2) if number of packaged events equals MAX_SEND_AMOUNT, send, otherwise wait again.
-- Note: packaging has been disabled since it delays too much

local MAX_SEND_AMOUNT = 1 -- max number of events that can be packaged into a send -- (disabled)
--local MAX_SEND_AMOUNT = 4 -- max number of events that can be packaged into a send
local MAX_WAIT_TIME = 100 -- max delay (ms) between two events for them to be part of a single send package (can't be less than 50ms)
